Gait Analysis :
Gait analysis is the study of human motion, particularly how people walk or run. It involves observing and measuring body movements,
mechanics, and muscle activity. Itâ€™s used to assess and treat individuals with walking difficulties, improve athletic performance, 
and prevent injuries. It can range from simple observations to detailed computer analysis of biomechanics.

Here we created a program that analyse a subject's gait with thhe web cam of a Laptop or computer. We have to just insert the shoulder length 
the subject in the program. And then the subeject will have to stand at a certain distance for a few seconds to calibrate the code. Only one calibration 
in certain setup will enough.
